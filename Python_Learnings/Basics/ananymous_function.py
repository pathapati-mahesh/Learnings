# LAMBDA FUNCTION

# SYNTAX: 
# lambda arguments: expression
exp_value=lambda x,y:x**y
# tHE abOVE LINE WILL DO THE SAME Job as the Below Function the no of lines is reduced when we use this ananymous function and  
#also we have to use this function only when we have a single line expressions
# def square_Num(num,val):
#     return num**val
print(exp_value(5,2))
print(exp_value(4,3))
